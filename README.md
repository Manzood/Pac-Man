Can be run using the executable file provided.
However, this executable file had been built on a linux Ubuntu distribution, so compatibility with your system will vary.
Compilation in C can be done if the SDL2 library is installed, which can bewith further ease using the Makefile provided.
The remaining assets, used or unused, are also provided in this repository.
You should be able to build it on another system with the SDL2 and TTF libraries installed.

There are various tutorials for installing SDL2 on your computer, which will be required to run the code in this project
The main website for SDL2 is linked here: 
 https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php. <br>
On linux, a simple look at this tutorial could help with installation:      https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php. <br>

Also, it is imperative that the code be downloaded alongside all the other images and other assets provided, without which it is needless to say that the final build will not run properly.
The names of the images and files should also not be changed; this will result in errors.

The images used in this project were found from various sources on the internet, and edited to suit the project.

SDL_ttf is a library that I had insttalled on linux using the command: "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf.dev"
That's all that was required on linux
