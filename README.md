<h2> Pac-Man </h2> <br>

A clone of Pac-Man, written in C during my first year of college, using the library SDL2.

Compilation in C can be done if the SDL2 library is installed.
The remaining assets used are also provided in this repository.
You should be able to build it regardless of OS as long as the SDL2 and TTF libraries installed.

There are various tutorials for installing SDL2 on your computer, which will be required to run the code in this project
The main website for SDL2 is linked here:
 https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php. <br>
On linux, a simple look at this tutorial could help with installation:      https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php. <br>

Also, it is imperative that the code be downloaded alongside all the other images and other assets provided, without which it is needless to say that the final build will not run properly.
The names of the images and files should also not be changed; this will result in errors.

The images used in this project were found from various sources on the internet, and edited to suit the project.

SDL_ttf is a library that I had insttalled on linux using the command: "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf.dev"
That's all that was required on linux

For Windows users, they seem to have a lot more detailed and simplified instructions on the main SDL-ttf website:
  https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/. <br>

Also, a tutorial on SDL_ttf can be found here:
  http://gigi.nullneuron.net/gigilabs/displaying-text-in-sdl2-with-sdl_ttf/

On linux, the command to install the SDL2_image library is:
    ```sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev```
